# AI Devs docker

Docker env for AI Devs examples. I just don't like the idea of having node on my machine ;).

### Prerequisites

`docker`, `docker compose` plugin (not to be confused with legacy `docker-compose`), `git`, `make`, and petabytes of disk space for node_modules ;).

### How to run:

Just run `make install`.
AI Devs repo will be cloned to subdirectory called `3rd-devs`, which is gitignored in this repo so you can tinker at will there.
